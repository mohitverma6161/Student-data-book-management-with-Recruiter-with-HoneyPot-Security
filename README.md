# Student-data-book-management-with-Recruiter-with-HoneyPot-Security or MyTijori

## Introduction

It is be a web-app which will help students in a
college/school to keep his/her data in an organized manner. It is mainly useful for
educational establishments to manage student data which also facilitates all individual
associated information for easier navigation on daily basis. The student will provide
his/her information (personal info, related documents, projects) and the recruitment
team can navigate to students information upon the permission received. The recruiter
can easily search a student and see his/her details. Our easy-to-use, application would
be used to reduce time, as to concentrate on other skillful practical activities other than
book worming.
We also try to implement Honey-Pot like server which will act as a proxy server for
any main server. Honey-Pot is used to track the behavior of attacks which are done on
any main servers. By studying the type of attacks, the system designers design the
system update in such a way that it may cover all the loopholes in the system. As the
title states that it’ll be a honeypot like structure and not the exact honeypot. Our system
will not only record the IPs and location but it will also take the screenshots of the
user’s system so that the images can be studied later and the exact activities can be
traced out. The need for this system is because along with tracking IP of the user, taking
screenshots might give us a clear vision of any kind of unusual activity.
